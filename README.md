Macresolve:
----------
Currently I have completed most of Macresolve, which with the -r option will read in the OUI list from IEEE, and store it in a file on the host. By using the -a <Mac Address> function it will allow you to see based on the list which company the Mac address belongs to. 
--Additional features I will add is the help function, along with making sure you have the file already on your first run, otherwise it will automatically retrieve the file.
